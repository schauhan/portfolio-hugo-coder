## Other Interests ##
---
**International Diplomacy and Geopolitics**

Primarily interested in Asian geo-political scene - India-Pakistan relations, China's diplomatic strategy as a rising global power

**Hindi**

Making the internet more accessible to people who don't speak English. I am interested in preserving and popularizing languages with non-Romain script. Case in point: Over half the content on the internet is in English, while less than 20% of the world's population comprises of native English speakers.

**Climate Change | Global Warming**

Stopping the globally rising temperatures is important if we are to survive on this planet. I am open to working with leaders on finding sustainable solutions to stop global warming. Some ideas - finding alternatives to plastic, putting the onus of pollution from the consumers to plastic manufacturers, finding alternatives to fossil fuel (renewable energy, fuel cell), etc.
