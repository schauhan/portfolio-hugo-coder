+++

I am a product manager based in Austin. I build software products which solve customer problems and are intuitive and a delight to use.

Over the years I've acquired skills which help me create beautiful, useful products

- Data Driven - I want to measure the impact of what I build - here is what I do with data <*link to GitHub project*>
- Analytical - I decompose complex problems into smaller parts so they can be tackled individually
- Tech Background - I've written code for almost 10 years. This helps me create and work with high-performance dev teams.
- Research - It's not only about finding answers, but also about asking the right question. Sounds cliched but I've experienced that asking 3 "Why"s in a row can help you uncover the real pain-point of your customer.

## Other Interests ##

While I am not working on products I follow a few other interests

- International Diplomacy and Geopolitics - I am primarily interested in Asian geopolitical scene; topics like India-Pakistan relations, China's diplomatic strategy as a rising global power, etc
- Hindi - Over half the content on the internet is in English, while not more than 20% of the world's population speaks English. I am interested in creating web content in non-Roman languages and making the internet more accessible to people who don't speak English.
- Climate Change | Global Warming - Stopping the globally rising temperatures is important if we are to survive on this planet. I am open to working with leaders on finding sustainable solutions to stop global warming. Some ideas - finding alternatives to plastic, putting the onus of pollution from the consumers to plastic manufacturers, finding alternatives to fossil fuel (renewable energy, fuel cell), etc.
